Problem 3, 4, 5 are updated


This assignment was done by Sayantika Sengupta, Aniket Saha and Anjan Mondal. The problems 1 and 2 were done by Aniket Saha, 3 and 5 by Sayantika Sengupta and problem 4 by Anjan Mondal.

This assignment included various datasets and experiments which were modelled using various probability distributions like Gamma, lognormal, Laplace and various Mixture Models. These problems also required us to delve into model selection methods using Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion. We also performed some Computational Finance techniques on TCS stock price dataset. For the TCS dataset, the daily returns of the stock price were modelled.
